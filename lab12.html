                    <h2>TASKS: </h2>
                    <h3>PLANNING INITIAL STRATEGY:</h3>
                    <p>To begin planning, I numbered all the turns and line segments that I wanted the robot to follow. I marked these numbers directly onto the diagram provided for the lab. Strategically, I divided the world into two sections: the <b>upper section</b>, which includes lines 5–6, 6–7, and 7–origin; and the <b>lower section</b>, which includes all other segments. </p>
                    <img src="waypoints diagram.png" alt="waypoints diagram" class="lab-image">
                    <p>For the lower section, I planned to use open-loop control combined with orientation PID control. For the upper section, I intended to use orientation PID control along with linear PID control for more precise movement.</p>
                    <p>To simplify the code, I decided to initially orient the robot so it faced "up," parallel to the x-axis, and then have it move clockwise toward waypoint #2. Initially, I assumed the robot could make clean 45-degree turns at each waypoint—clockwise for waypoints 2–4, followed by counterclockwise turns for the remaining waypoints.</p>
                    <h3>TESTING & DEBUGGING:</h3>
                    <p>However, during testing, I noticed that the 45-degree turns caused the robot to overshoot. To correct this, I adjusted the angles to smaller, more precise values: 20, 20, and 25 degrees clockwise, followed by 25, 30, 30, and 30 degrees counterclockwise. For this section, I reused the orientation PID control code I had previously developed for Lab 11.</p>
                    <p>For the upper section, I initially planned to use linear PID control and have the robot stop one foot away from the wall. Since the target waypoint is 1.5 feet from the wall and the front of the robot accounts for about 0.5 feet, this seemed like a reasonable cutoff distance. At this point, my code for the lower section was functioning correctly, so I began integrating the upper section strategy.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, I encountered issues with the front ToF sensor. It consistently gave inaccurate distance measurements, even when I tested it using the old GET_TOF case from earlier labs. As a result, I decided to use the same strategy from the lower section—relying on orientation PID and open-loop timing—for the upper section as well. This approach worked reliably.</p>

                    <p>Unfortuantely, I initially forgot to add the final forward movement after turn #7, so the robot never reached the final waypoint (the origin). After more than 30 test runs, the battery started to lose power, reducing the accuracy of the robot's performance. I replaced the battery with a fully charged one and re-ran the code. The robot completed a much more accurate run, though it still didn't reach the last waypoint due to the missing forward movement code.</p>
