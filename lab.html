                    <h3>P-CONTROL:</h3>
                    <p>For the P controller, I wrote code in the <code>loop</code> function that continuously checks the state of the <code>PID_live</code> flag. When <code>PID_live</code> is true, the robot starts collecting data and adjusts its movement based on its distance from the goal. It either moves forward or reverses accordingly. The speed for this adjustment is calculated by a separate function I created, <code>pos_control</code>, which returns the PWM value for the proportional control term.</p>

                    <p>I conducted several tests with different gain values, starting at 0.1 and then adjusting to 0.05. With Kp = 0.1, the robot would crash into the wall before reversing, while with Kp = 0.05, it stopped too early, leaving a significant gap from the target. After further testing, I found that a gain of 0.08 yielded the best results, with the robot stopping at approximately 350 mm—about 50 mm short of the goal distance. </p>

                    <p>For my PI-control I ran into many issues. In many cases the car would just ran straight to the wall, back up and go again and then it would reach steady state at around the right value. When I ran that code with a Ki value of 0.01. I got these values: </p>

                    <p>I did perfect my code, but by that time my battery had died so I could only run it while connected to the computer and just see the output by the print statements in the serial monitor. I ran this code with a Ki value of 0.01 and started the robot at around 15 inches ~ 370 mm and then went oscillating from there to 304mm. When I was about to reach the goal distance, the error blew up (not seen in the video, I stopped recording too early).</p>

                    <p>Given these tests, I decided to go with a smaller Ki value, around 0.0001. Just because 0.01 proved itself wrong multiple times so I think decreasing as much as possible would be the best for a Ki value.</p>
                    
                    <h3>PID-CONTROL:</h3>
                    <p>My battery died at this point, but I was able to do my code and debug it while having the robot connected to my computer and just printing out statements and data in the serial monitor. I ran this code with the values of Kp=0.08, Ki=0.0001 and Kd = 0.5. Started the robot at around 15 inches ~ 370 mm and then went oscillating from there to 304mm.</p>

                    <p>I implemented the wind up for my integrator in my pos_control function. When the wind up was not implemented the sum of the error kept incrementing and at first I was running the code without it and the robot would run straight to the wall, crash, do a flip and then I would stop it. At lab when I ran it again, it went straight to the wall at full speed, backed up at full speed, did a flip and then the battery came off. I then talked with my TA and I refined my wind up which now is like this:  </p>
                    <pre><code>
  float pos_control(float pid_error, float stop, float timelapsed) {

    sumError = constrain(sumError, -1000, 1000);
    i_control = K_i * sumError;
    if (i_control > 100) i_control = 100;
