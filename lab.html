                    <h3>Objective: <span class="objective-text">To familiarize myself with the Arduino IDE and the Artemis board. Get comfortable programming the board, managing basic outputs, communicating via serial connection, and utilizing the onboard sensors.</span></h3>
                    <h3>Pre-Lab: <span class="objective-text">Installed the latest versions of Arduino IDE and Sparkfun Apollo3 boards manager.</span></h3>

                    <p>Uploaded the Blink.ino code to the RedBoard Artemis Nano.</p>

                    <p>Uploaded the Example04_Serial.ino code to the RedBoard Artemis Nano.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Task 3: Temperature</h3>
                    <div class="video-container">
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L2gW-0fc3KY?si=kfwtEcmecsuXr9p7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>Uploaded the Example02_AnalogRead.ino code to the RedBoard Artemis Nano. As I read the Serial Monitor, I realized that the temperature was not in units that I could easily understand, so I commented out the two Serial.print commands the original code had. I added my own Serial.print for the variable temp_f which contains the calculated temperature value in Farenheit.</p>

                    <h3>Task 4: Microphone</h3>

                    </div>
                    <p>Uploaded the Example1_MicrophoneOutput.ino to the RedBoard Artemis Nano and experimented with different pitches to observe the loudest frequency displayed.  </p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Task 5: Blink with C-note</h3>
                    <div class="video-container">
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W2kiBlS4Hjk?si=SheHTA2CsTtCsFDl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>I combined the Blink.ino and Example1_MicrophoneOutput.ino sketches into one and uploaded it to the board. Then, I searched online for a site that could play a C-note and found one that played both C3 and C4. I played these notes and observed their threshold frequencies. I decided to program the board for the C3 note and added an if-statement in the loop function of the new sketch to turn on the LED if the loudest frequency was within that threshold.   </p>

                    <h1>Lab 1B: Bluetooth</h1>
                    <h3>Objective: <span class="objective-text">To establish communication between my computer and the Artemis board via Bluetooth, which I will later use to send data from the Artemis board to the computer. To also be able to send Python commands from a Jupyter Notebook to the Artemis board while running Arduino.</span></h3>
                    <h3>Pre-Lab: <span class="objective-text"> Since I had the latest version of the Arduino, I proceeded with creating a new virtial environment named “FastRobots_ble”. I then activated the virtual environment so I could start working on Jupyter Lab. </span></h3>
                    <h3>Configurations: <span class="objective-text"> First thing I did was upload the ble_arduino.ino code to the Artemis board and get its MAC Address. With this I updated the artemis_address in connections.yaml. I proceeded with generating a new UUID so that it is unique to my board and I replaced the BLEService UUID in the ble_arduino.ino with this new UUID. I connected the Artemis board with the computer via Bluetooth by uploading this code in Jupyter Lab:</span></h3>
