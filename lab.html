                    </div>
                    <p>Uploaded the Example02_AnalogRead.ino code to the RedBoard Artemis Nano. As I read the Serial Monitor, I realized that the temperature was not in units that I could easily understand, so I commented out the two Serial.print commands the original code had. I added my own Serial.print for the variable temp_f which contains the calculated temperature value in Farenheit.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>I combined the Blink.ino and Example1_MicrophoneOutput.ino sketches into one and uploaded it to the board. Then, I searched online for a site that could play a C-note and found one that played both C3 and C4. I played these notes and observed their threshold frequencies. I decided to program the board for the C3 note and added an if-statement in the loop function of the new sketch to turn on the LED if the loudest frequency was within that threshold.   </p>

                <div class="lab-text">
                    <h1>Lab 1B: Bluetooth</h1>
                    <h3>Objective: <span class="objective-text">To establish communication between my computer and the Artemis board via Bluetooth, which I will later use to send data from the Artemis board to the computer. To also be able to send Python commands from a Jupyter Notebook to the Artemis board while running Arduino.</span></h3>
                    <h3>Pre-Lab: <span class="objective-text"> Since I had the latest version of the Arduino, I proceeded with creating a new virtial environment named “FastRobots_ble”. I then activated the virtual environment so I could start working on Jupyter Lab. </span></h3>
                    <h3>Configurations: <span class="objective-text"> First thing I did was upload the ble_arduino.ino code to the Artemis board and get its MAC Address. With this I updated the artemis_address in connections.yaml. I proceeded with generating a new UUID so that it is unique to my board and I replaced the BLEService UUID in the ble_arduino.ino with this new UUID. I connected the Artemis board with the computer via Bluetooth by uploading this code in Jupyter Lab:</span></h3>
                    <img src="bLE.png" alt="Bluetooth code" class="lab-image">
                    <br>
                    
                    <h3>Task 1: Echo</h3>
                    <p>For this task I analyzed the commands PING and SEND_TWO_INTS in the ble_arduino.ino code. With multiple hours of running and debugging I was able to understand what each of their commands do and make something similar for the ECHO command. This is my ECHO command: </p>
                    <img src="ECHO.png" alt="ECHO command" class="lab-image">
                    <p>And this is the Python side of it and how the computer replied to the ECHO command:</p>
                    <img src="task1_python.png" alt="Python Echo response" class="lab-image">
                    <br>

                    <h3>Task 2: SEND_THREE_FLOATS</h3>
                    <p>I started by looking at the command SENT_TWO_INTS once again. I figured that if they are doing this with integers I could modify it so it takes in floats instead of integers, and that is what I did. I copy pasted the code, changed the class to a float and added an extra one so it is three floats being extracted. This is how the command looks in Arduino: </p>
                    <img src="send three floats.png" alt="Send Three Floats Command" class="lab-image">
                    <p>This is the command that was sent via Python:</p>
                    <img src="floats python.png" alt="Send Three Floats Python" class="lab-image">
                    <p>This is what the Serial Monitor in Arduino printed out:</p>
                    <img src="floats serial monitor.png" alt="Send Three Floats Arduino" class="lab-image">
                    <br>

                    <h3>Task 3: GET_TIME_MILLIS</h3>
                    <p>At first, I searched if there is a function in Arduino that would give you the time in milliseconds. Once I saw there is, I copied the code from the ECHO command and modified it so it would print the value of millis(). I ran into an error uploading the code to the board because I forgot to write a class for the millis function, but I then added double and I was able to upload it. This is my GET_TIME_MILLIS command:  </p>
                    <img src="millis arduino.png" alt="Get time millis Command" class="lab-image">
                    <p>Then, when I was trying to call the command on Python it kept showing an error that said “ AttributeError: GET_TIME_MILLIS”. I had not seen this error before and I could not understand it so I asked AI what the error meant and it said that “the command doesn’t exist in the CMD enum”. I remembered seeing in the folder ble_python a code called “cmd_types.py” that looked similar to what AI showed me. I went to that code and added the GET_TIME_MILLIS to it, following ECHO which is how I wrote it in the ble_arduino.ino code, and this is what the Python side looked like after I got it to work: </p>
                    <img src="millis_python.png" alt="Get time millis Python" class="lab-image">
                    <br>

                    <h3>Task 4: Notification Handler</h3>
                    <p> For this task, I created a notification handler that would receive the string from the board and extract the number. In the function I decided to look for "T:" in the string and extract whatever is after that. I was able to do this with the split function I found in the Python cheatsheet that's in the course website. </p>
                    <img src="notif handler.png" alt="Notification handler" class="lab-image">
                    <br>

                    <h3>Task 5: Time Data Sending Loop </h3>
                    <p>I first pasted the code from GET_TIME_MILLIS and then I added the condition so it only collects data for 5 seconds. I initialized both variables at the top of the code (as unsigned long) and then added this new function to the cmd_types.py code. This is TIME_SEND_LOOP in Arduino: </p>
                    <img src="time_send_loop.png" alt="Time Send Loop" class="lab-image">
                    <p>I ran into a few issues with the Python side and then i wanted to add some kind of index value to each line so I ended up altering my notification_handler function. This is the latest version:</p>
                    <img src="notification_handler.png" alt="Updated Notification Handler" class="lab-image"> 
                    <p>And this is what I called in Python and the output. There were 273 timestamps sent from the Arduino in 5 seconds which is about 54.6 messages per second. </p>
                    <img src="python_output.png" alt="Python Output" class="lab-image">
                    <br>

                    <h3>Task 6: Sending Time Data with Arrays </h3>
                    <p>Before diving into the commands, here are the variables I had to initialize globally.</p>
                    <img src="initialized variables.png" alt="Initialized variables" class="lab-image">
                    <p>Here are the updated TIME_SEND_LOOP and the SEND_TIME_DATA. I added a break to the TIME_SEND_LOOP because when I ran it initially it was on a forever printing loop.</p>
                    <img src="new commands.png" alt="New commands" class="lab-image">
                    <p>And this is the Python side:</p>
                    <img src="python interface.png" alt="Python" class="lab-image">
                    <br>

                    <h3>Task 7: Sending Time and Temperature with Arrays </h3>
                    <p>I combined my two commands from before (TIME_SEND_LOOP and SEND_TIME_DATA) and then added the getTempDegF function we used in Lab 1A. When printing I ran into isuees with the time going back after increasing so I joined my while and if statements. I also added a few delays throughout the code so the sensor can have some time to think. </p>
                    <img src="get temp readings.png" alt="Python" class="lab-image">
                    <p>This is the Python side with the output:</p>
                    <img src="get temp readings python.png" alt="Python" class="lab-image">
                    <br>
